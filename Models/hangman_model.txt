# At a trial a prisoner is sentenced to death. The verdict reads "You will be executed next week, but the day on which you will be executed is a surprise to you." The prisoner reasons as follows. "I cannot be executed on Friday, because in that case I would not be surprised. But given that Friday is eliminated, then I cannot be executed on Thursday either, because that would then no longer be a surprise. And so on. Therefore the verdict cannot be executed." And so, his execution, that happened to be on Wednesday, came as a surprise.
